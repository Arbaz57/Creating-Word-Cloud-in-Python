**What is Word Cloud?**

A word cloud is an image of several words. The size of the words represent the frequency of that word in our data.
Word Cloud is also refered as **_'Tag Cloud'_**.

**Where is Word Cloud used?**

1) Top Hashtags on Social Media(Instagram, Twitter): Throughout the world, social media is trending for the latest updates, so from that we can get the most used Hashtags that people use in their posts.

2) Hot Topics In Media: Analyzing the news articles, we can find the keywords in the headlines and extract the top and demanding topics and to get the desired result i.e the top and trending media topics.

3) Search Term in an E-commerce: In an e-commerce shopping website, the owner can make the word cloud of the shopping items that have been searched the most. So, he can get the idea about which shopping is in great demand during a specific period.
